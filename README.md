## **Overview**
Wind turbine fault detection is critical to ensuring optimal energy production and minimizing downtime. This repository provides:
- A **real-time dashboard** for monitoring turbine health and weather data.
- Integration with **real-time APIs** (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) for weather information.
- Analytical tools for fault prediction.

---

## **Features**
- Real-time weather monitoring (wind speed, temperature, etc.).
- Visualizations for:
  - Wind speed trends over time.
  - Temperature trends.
  - Fault prediction insights.
- Uses **Streamlit** for a simple and interactive web-based dashboard.
- Handles and processes **CSV-based turbine data**.
